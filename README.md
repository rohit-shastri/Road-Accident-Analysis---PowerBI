### Road-Accident-Analysis---PowerBI
Road Accident Analysis using Power BI is like using a special tool to look at information about car crashes. With Power BI, we gather data about accidents, like where they happen, when, and why. Then, we organize this information into easy-to-understand charts and graphs. These visuals help us see patterns and trends, like which roads are most dangerous or if accidents happen more often in bad weather. By studying these patterns, we can make smarter decisions to prevent accidents and keep roads safer for everyone. It's basically using a cool tool to understand car crashes better and make roads safer.
